AccessScan – Master Quick Tests
 One■page checks to verify each implemented spec step
9.1 – PDF Parity: Content
Ensure the exported PDF mirrors the on■screen report content.

■ Generate a PDF via Report → Download PDF.

■ Confirm the issues table shows a column titled “How to fix (code)” with monospace snippets.

■ Confirm a “Human checks (4)” section appears after the tables, listing the checklist items.

■ Confirm severity grouping order is Critical → Serious → Moderate → Minor.

■ Confirm the PDF includes ALL issues (expanded), not only Top■5.
9.1 – PDF Parity: Score Donut
The PDF should show a donut like the on■screen report.

■ Generate a PDF and locate the score block under the header.

■ Visually verify a circular donut with an indigo progress arc and the score number in the center.

■ Select the score text next to the donut to confirm it’s real text (searchable), e.g., “97 / 100”.
9.1 – PDF Parity: Header Note & Link
The PDF header mirrors the on■screen meta note and labels, and the URL is clickable.

■ On the on■screen report, note the banner line (duration + timestamp).

■ Generate a PDF and check the first page header area shows “Completed in X s  Generated: …
(Europe/London)”.

■ Confirm the right■hand header shows “View: Before/After” matching the current dataset.

■ Move your cursor over the URL in the header; verify it is clickable and opens the correct page.
9.1 – Full Acceptance Sweep (PDF)
Do this once to conclude PDF parity is complete.

■ Donut + trend are visible and match the on■screen report.

■ Header includes “Completed in X s  Generated: …” and the dataset label (“View: Before/After”).

■ URL in the PDF header is clickable.

■ Issues table includes “How to fix (code)” with readable snippets.

■ A “Human checks (4)” section appears after tables.

■ All issues are present (expanded), grouped by severity.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

10.1 – Avoid Actions That Do Nothing (incl. 10.2 spot checks)
No dead clicks; disabled controls show clear reasons; ARIA states stay correct.

■ In the Before/After switch: the active button (e.g., Before) is disabled; the other is enabled and switches on
click.

■ “Show After (demo)” is disabled when After is active (title shows “Already showing After”).

■ On the Overview tab: “Copy quick■fix pack” is disabled if there are no automatable fixes (e.g., in After).

■ Export buttons are disabled when there are no issues to export (tooltip explains why).

■ Tab through the controls: pressed/selected/disabled ARIA states are announced correctly (10.2).
6.1 – Automation Coverage Box (UI)
On the Overview tab, show a concise two■column panel describing what tools cover vs what needs a human.

■ Open Report → Overview; verify a rounded two■column box appears: “Automated (tools)” vs “Needs a
human)”.

■ Keyboard■only: Tab through and confirm it is reachable and announced with aria■label “Automation
coverage”.

■ Toggle Before/After and confirm the same box appears on both (content is static in the demo).

■ Export a PDF and confirm the PDF contains the equivalent two■panel content near the top.
1.1 – Scan Note Placement
The scan note sits immediately under the grey banner, in both visual and reading order.

■ Reload the Report page.

■ Confirm the line “Scan completed in X s  Last generated: …” appears directly under the grey banner
paragraph.

■ Keyboard: from the banner, press Tab; focus should proceed to the next interactive element after the note.
6.1 – No Duplicate Coverage Box
Keep only the concise two■column coverage panel.

■ Scroll near the top of the Report; verify you see only one coverage section — the concise two■column grid.

■ Screen reader: navigate by headings/landmarks; you should encounter that coverage section once only.
Tip: if any check fails, re■run just that section after applying the relevant patch.
